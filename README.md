README: The Impact of Interest Rates and Economic Indicators on Credit Categories

Project Title

Analysis of Interest Rate Sensitivity on Household, Firm, and Bank Credit

Description

This project explores the impact of interest rates (Federal Funds Rate, DFF) and macroeconomic variables like GDP, unemployment rate, and inflation (CPIAUCSL) on three key credit categories:

Household credit

Firm credit

Bank credit

The analysis aims to understand how monetary policy affects credit markets, with a focus on sectoral differences in sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Key Features

Multivariate Analysis: Explores relationships between interest rates, GDP, unemployment, and inflation on different credit categories.

Modeling Techniques:

OLS Regression for linear modeling.

SARIMAX for temporal dependencies.

Random Forest for feature importance.

Comparison Table: Provides a side-by-side comparison of household, firm, and bank credit responses to macroeconomic variables.

Results Summary

Household credit is the most sensitive to interest rate changes (-0.0308 per 1% increase in DFF).

GDP is a consistent and significant positive predictor across all credit categories.

Firm credit is negatively influenced by unemployment, while inflation has minimal impact across all models.

Autocorrelation plays a significant role in household credit dynamics.
